Name
    beanstalkd-nginx-module - An nginx module that talks to beanstalkd(a
    fast, general-purpose work queue). It supports put, reserve, delete, and
    many more beanstalkd commands.

    *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the
    installation instructions.

Version
    This module is still under development, will be released soon.

Installation
        Get the nginx source code from nginx.org ( http://nginx.org/ ).
        Unpack the source code of nginx and this module, then build nginx with this module.

        $ wget 'http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.0.8.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-1.0.8.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-1.0.8/

        $ git-clone http://github.com/calio/beanstalkd-nginx-module.git

        $ ./configure --add-module=/somepath/beanstalkd-nginx-module
        $ make -j2
        $ make install (may need sudo)

        And now you can find your nginx with beanstalkd-nginx-module in '/usr/local/nginx' if you don't change 'prefix' at configuration.

Synopsis
        location /foo {
            set $job "hello";
            beanstalkd_query put 1 1 1 $job;
            beanstalkd_pass 127.0.0.1:11300;
        }

      http {
        ...
        upstream backend {
           server 127.0.0.1:11300;
           server 127.0.0.1:11301;
        }
        server {
            location /foo {
                set $cmd "put";
                set $dest "backend";
                beanstalkd_query $cmd 1 1 1 "hello";
                beanstalkd_pass $dest;
            }
            ...
        }
      }
      ...

Description
    This module supports "put", "reserve",  "reserve-with-timeout" and "delete"
    commands of beanstalkd ascii protocol.
    (<https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt >).

    It allows you to define a custom REST
    (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST >) interface to your beanstalkd
    servers or access beanstalkd in a very efficient way from within the
    nginx server.

    This module is not supposed to be merged into the Nginx core because
    I've used Ragel (<http://www.complang.org/ragel/ >) to generate the
    beanstalkd response parsers (in C) for joy :)
